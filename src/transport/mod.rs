//! ### Sending Messages
//!
//! This section explains how to manipulate emails you have created.
//!
//! This mailer contains several different transports for your emails. To be sendable, the
//! emails have to implement `Email`, which is the case for emails created with `lettre::builder`.
//!
//! The following transports are available:
//!
//! * The `SmtpTransport` uses the SMTP protocol to send the message over the network. It is
//!   the preferred way of sending emails.
//! * The `SendmailTransport` uses the sendmail command to send messages. It is an alternative to
//!   the SMTP transport.
//! * The `FileTransport` creates a file containing the email content to be sent. It can be used
//!   for debugging or if you want to keep all sent emails.
//! * The `StubTransport` is useful for debugging, and only prints the content of the email in the
//!   logs.
